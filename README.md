Hi, I´m Zoe and I´m taking a course at coursera, my parents told me about it (they are profesors at University of Guadalajara), becuse i want to scape from Mexico, it´s a beatiful place, but like they say "don´t judge a book because of its cover page". So here i am, trying to learn as much as i can, hoping to take a job in Canada:)
I´m in love with Emily bby, but our love must die:(
